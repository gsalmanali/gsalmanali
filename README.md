# 👋 Hi, I'm Salman Ali!

🎓 I hold a PhD in Computer Science from Michigan State University, where I focused on building distributed and decentralized collaboration frameworks for complex supply chains. My work focused on enhancing traceability, transparency, and addressing environmental issues, particularly in the beef supply chain.

💻 I'm passionate about:
- Distributed and decentralized applications
- Blockchain, Web 3.0, and Federated Learning
- Security aspects of networks and applications
- Teaching and mentoring in computer science

🏆 Achievements:
- Best Paper Award at ISNCC 2024
- Presented research internationally and across MSU departments
- Awarded multiple fellowships throughout my PhD

🌱 Currently, I’m exploring AI applications for complex supply chains in collaboration with Professor Cedric Gondro in the Animal Sciences Department at MSU, while also building my skills in cloud computing, DevOps, solutions architecture, and network security within the Azure ecosystem.
