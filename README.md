# 👋 Hi, I'm Salman Ali!

🎓 I hold a PhD in Computer Science from Michigan State University, where I focused on building distributed and decentralized collaboration frameworks for complex supply chains. My work focused on enhancing traceability, transparency, and addressing environmental issues, particularly in the beef supply chain, with an emphasis on federated data management.

💻 I'm passionate about:
- Distributed and decentralized applications
- Blockchain and Web 3.0
- Data Federation and Federated Learning 
- Security aspects of networks and applications
- Teaching and mentoring in computer science

🏆 Recent Achievements:
- Best Paper Award at ISNCC 2024
- Presented research internationally and across MSU departments
- Awarded multiple fellowships throughout my PhD
- Extensive teaching experience, including instructing from basic programming to advanced full-stack web development and object-oriented programming

🌱 Currently, I’m exploring AI applications for complex supply chain networks under Professor Cedric Gondro in the Animal Sciences Department at MSU.
